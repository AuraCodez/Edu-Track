# Classroom Clone
This is a full stack web application that I am making using Flask and Python as the back end and front-end Boot Strap CSS/HTML/JS/JQuery. I am making
a clean interface for teachers to track their students progress, upload assignments and assign grades to the students. So far, it's just a CRUD application.

I am actively working on


- Make a login system for the teachers to login
- Make a seperate login system for students to login
-  Make is so that teachers can uppload assignment files and students can see it
- Make it so students can access and see their current grades


**(A current work in progress project!)**
